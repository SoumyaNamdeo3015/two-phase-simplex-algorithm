### about the alogrithm -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm

### about input.txt
#### The first two lines of input file contains the type of linear programming problem i.e maximizing or minimizing of the objective function.

#### Then it contains matirx A , followed by matrix b .

#### Then we have our constraint types which include >= , <= and = only.

#### at last matrix c (cost vector) is entered.


#### note:the input file name must be input.txt 

### about the code :

#### code contains a single function named simplex_algo : 

#### the return type of this function is a dictionary as follows :

####        key           --->         values
#### 1. initial_tableau  ::           stores initial tableau
#### 2. fina_tableau  ::                stores final tableau
#### 3. solution_status  ::             stores the status of the solution (either 'unbounded', 'optimal', or 'infeasible')
#### 4. optimal_solution  ::            stores optimal solution vector as a python list
#### 5. optimal_value  ::               stores the cost at optimal solution vector
